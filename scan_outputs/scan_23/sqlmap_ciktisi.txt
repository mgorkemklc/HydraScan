[12:12:09] [INFO] testing URL 'http://testphp.vulnweb.com/'
[12:12:09] [INFO] using '/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/results-01082026_1212pm.csv' as the CSV results file in multiple targets mode
[12:12:09] [INFO] testing connection to the target URL
[12:12:24] [CRITICAL] connection timed out to the target URL. sqlmap is going to retry the request(s)
[12:12:24] [WARNING] if the problem persists please check that the provided target URL is reachable. In case that it is, you can try to rerun with proxy switches ('--proxy', '--proxy-file'...)
[12:12:27] [INFO] testing if the target URL content is stable
[12:12:29] [WARNING] target URL content is not stable (i.e. content differs). sqlmap will base the page comparison on a sequence matcher. If no dynamic nor injectable parameters are detected, or in case of junk results, refer to user's manual paragraph 'Page comparison'
how do you want to proceed? [(C)ontinue/(s)tring/(r)egex/(q)uit] C
[12:12:29] [CRITICAL] can't check dynamic content because of lack of page content
[12:12:29] [ERROR] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment'), skipping to the next target
[12:12:29] [INFO] you can find results of scanning in multiple targets mode inside the CSV file '/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/results-01082026_1212pm.csv'
